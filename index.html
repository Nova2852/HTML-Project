  <h1>HTML PROJECT</h1>

  <p>I had no idea who to write on so I decided on myself. Here is a bit about my life:</p>
  <h2>Early life</h2>
  <p>I was born on the 29th of October 2006 in Brent, Harrow. Later on, in 2008, I moved to Farnborough.</p>

  <h2>My achievements</h2>
  <p>As an asian, I am inherently good as maths. Therefore, it may nto be a surprise that I got full marks in Maths SATS (but almost failed English). In my previous school, I became the house captain of my house (though I do not wish to pursue that anymore) and got Grade 8 in Maths.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>My future?</h2>
  <p>To be honest I have no clue what to do with my life. I think that because of the advancements in technology that have been made over the years, it would be useful to take Computing so that there are more available options for me.</p>
